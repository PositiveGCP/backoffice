Grant of License

1. Number of users & usage rights. 
Upon payment of the license fee, astype grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Font Software in a Licensed Unit for your own personal or internal business purposes according to the terms of this Agreement. You have no rights to the Font Software other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. If the number of users who use the Font Software exceeds those set forth in the definition of Licensed Unit above, then you must request from astype an appropriate license covering all users. An additional fee will be charged for this license extension. 

2. Embedding, online documents & interactive media. 
You may embed the Font Software in documents, applications or devices either as a rasterized representation of the Font Software (e.g., a GIF or JPEG file) or as a subset of the Font Software (e.g., as part of a PDF file) as long as the document, application or device is distributed in a secure format that permits only the viewing and printing but not the editing of the text. You need an additional OEM license (i) for the use of the Font Software in documents, applications or devices permitting editing of the text, if such documents, applications or devices shall be distributed to third parties or (ii) if the Font Software is embedded neither as a subset nor as a rasterized representation (e.g., video games, e-books, apps, media devices like smart phones and e-book readers). You need an additional web font license to use @ font-face embedding for websites. These additional license types can be obtained from astype and partly from astype distribution partners.

3. Broadcasting. 
For using the Font Software in broadcasts, video or film, an additional broadcasting license is needed and needs to be acquired prior to first use.

The broadcasting license is an annual renewable license extension.
